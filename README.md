Miscellaneous python scripts I made for a cybersecurity class. The objective of this class was to excite kids into perusing a career of Technology.

if you are missing some packages to run these scripts "%pip install x" will install packages from kernel.
ServiceExample 1 is a basic output file showing how to print from python, read print from CMD, and the beginning of subprocess where the host's IP address is released.
ServiceExample 2 launches a file bomb which produces large amount of meaningless .txt files
ServiceExample 3 remotely controls basic components of a computer, exp. brightness, volume, and web access. This is a fun script that unmute computer, sets target volume, and opens "x" amount of RickRolls
